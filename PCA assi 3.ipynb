This means there exists an invertible matrix P and a diagonal matrix D such that:\n\nA = PDP^(-1)\nMultiplying both sides by P, we get:\n\nAP = PD\nLet's denote the columns of P as p1, p2, ..., pn.

Since P is invertible, its columns must be linearly independent.\n\nConversely, suppose A has n linearly independent eigenvectors. Let P be the matrix whose columns are these eigenvectors.
