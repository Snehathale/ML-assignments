    "Both Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are techniques used to convert categorical data (like shirt colors: red, blue, green) into numerical representations for machine learning algorithms. However, they differ in how they treat the order of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: This method preserves the order of the categories by assigning numerical labels that reflect that order. For instance, consider a category like T-shirt size (small, medium, large). Ordinal encoding might assign 1 to \"small\", 2 to \"medium\", and 3 to \"large\" because large comes after medium which comes after small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Here, the order is ignored. The method simply assigns unique integer labels to each category. Sticking with the T-shirt size example, label encoding might assign 1 to \"small\", 2 to \"medium\", and surprisingly, it could also assign 3 to \"large\" or even 1 (as long as each category gets a unique number). There's no guarantee the assigned numbers reflect the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the Right Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Ordinal Encoding when the order of the categories is important for your analysis. Imagine you're building a model to predict customer spending based on their loyalty program tier (bronze, silver, gold). Since higher tiers typically spend more, ordinal encoding would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Label Encoding when the order doesn't matter.  For example, if you're predicting customer churn based on their favorite color (red, blue, green), the order doesn't influence churn, so label encoding would be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, ordinal encoding treats the categories like ranked positions, while label encoding treats them like unique names."

    "Target-guided ordinal encoding is a technique for encoding categorical features that leverages the relationship between the category and the target variable. It builds on the concept of ordinal encoding but injects information specific to the target variable to create a more informative numerical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the Target Statistic per Category:  For each category in your categorical feature, calculate a statistic that reflects how that category relates to the target variable. This statistic can be the mean, median, or another relevant measure depending on your target variable type (continuous vs classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort Categories:  Order the categories based on the calculated statistic from step 1.  Categories with higher target values (e.g., higher mean in regression) will be ranked higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign Encoding Values:  Assign numerical labels to each category based on their ranking from step 2. The category ranked first gets the value 1, the second gets 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a model to predict house prices. One feature is the neighborhood (Downtown, Suburban, Rural).  Target-guided encoding would be useful here because neighborhood likely influences house price.\n",

    "In most cases, the raw covariance is difficult to interpret directly due to the units.  This is why statisticians often use the correlation coefficient, which is a normalized version of covariance that ranges from -1 to 1 and is unitless, making it easier to interpret the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables."
