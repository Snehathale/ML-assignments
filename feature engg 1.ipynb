    "The Filter method is a technique used in feature selection for machine learning tasks. It essentially acts as a filter to identify and select the most relevant features from your dataset for building a model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Independent of Machine Learning Models: Unlike other feature selection methods, Filter methods don't rely on training a specific machine learning model. They operate independently and evaluate features based on statistical measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Assessments: The core of the Filter method lies in using statistical tests to assess the features' relationship with the target variable (in classification tasks) or the dependent variable (in regression tasks). These tests measure how well a feature captures the information relevant to the prediction you're trying to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Statistical Tests: Some commonly used statistical tests in Filter methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Gain: This metric calculates the reduction in uncertainty about the target variable after considering a particular feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-square test: This test assesses the independence between a feature and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's Score: This score evaluates the features' ability to distinguish between different classes in the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ranking and Selection: Once features are scored using these statistical tests, they are ranked based on their relevance. A threshold is then chosen to select the top-ranking features for further analysis or model building.\n",
