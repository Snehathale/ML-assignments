      "source": "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through the following mechanisms:\n\nEnsemble: By combining multiple decision trees, the model becomes less sensitive to the idiosyncrasies of any individual tree. If one tree overfits the training data, the others can help to balance it out.\nRandomness: The randomness introduced in the training process helps to prevent the model from memorizing the training data too closely. This is achieved by:\nBootstrapping: Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, creating different training sets and preventing overfitting on specific data points.\nFeature bagging: Each tree is trained on a random subset of features, reducing the correlation between trees and preventing overfitting on specific features.\nAggregation: The predictions from all the trees are combined, typically through averaging or voting. This helps to smooth out the predictions and reduce the impact of individual trees that might overfit.\nBy combining these techniques, Random Forest Regressor effectively reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the generalization performance of the model.",

      "source": "Random Forest Regressor typically aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees using one of two methods:\n\nAveraging: The predictions from all the trees are averaged to produce the final prediction. This is the most common method used in Random Forest Regressor.\nVoting: The predictions from all the trees are voted on, and the prediction with the most votes is chosen as the final prediction. This method is less common but can be useful in certain scenarios, such as when the predictions are categorical.\nIn both cases, the aggregation process helps to reduce the variance of the predictions and improve the stability of the model. By combining the predictions from multiple trees, the model becomes less sensitive to the idiosyncrasies of any individual tree, and the final prediction is more likely to be accurate and reliable.",

Increasing this number generally improves accuracy but also increases computational cost.   \nmax_depth: The maximum depth of each decision tree. Limiting the depth can prevent overfitting but may also reduce accuracy.\nmin_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. A larger value can prevent overfitting but may also reduce accuracy.\nmin_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A larger value can prevent overfitting but may also reduce accuracy.\nmax_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split. A smaller value can reduce computational cost but may also reduce accuracy.\nbootstrap: Whether or not to use bootstrapping when sampling data for each tree. Bootstrapping can help prevent overfitting.\ncriterion: The function to measure the quality of a split. Common options include \"mse\" (mean squared error) and \"mae\" (mean absolute error).\nTuning these hyperparameters can be time-consuming, but it can significantly improve the performance of the Random Forest Regressor model. Grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are common techniques used for hyperparameter tuning.",
