    "Bayes' Theorem: Updating Beliefs with Evidence\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to calculate the probability of an event based on new information or evidence. It's a cornerstone of Bayesian statistics, a method of statistical inference that updates beliefs about something as more information becomes available.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The Formula\n",
    "The theorem is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B): Probability of event A happening, given that event B has already happened (posterior probability)   \n",
    "P(B|A): Probability of event B happening, given that event A has already happened (likelihood)\n",
    "P(A): Probability of event A happening (prior probability)\n",
    "P(B): Probability of event B happening (marginal probability)\n",
    "What Does it Mean?\n",
    "In simpler terms, Bayes' theorem helps you update your belief about something (prior probability) based on new evidence (likelihood). The result is a revised belief (posterior probability).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to determine if someone has a disease based on a test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior probability: The overall chance of having the disease in the population.\n",
    "Likelihood: The probability of testing positive if you have the disease.\n",
    "Posterior probability: The chance of actually having the disease given a positive test result.\n",
    "Bayes' theorem helps you calculate this posterior probability, which is often more accurate than simply looking at the test result alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications\n",
    "Bayes' theorem has a wide range of applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Medicine: Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms and test results.\n",
    "Finance: Assessing investment risks and returns.\n",
