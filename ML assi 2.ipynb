    "Overfitting happens when a model memorizes the training data too well, capturing even the noise and irrelevant details.

    "Regularization in machine learning is a set of techniques employed to combat the issue of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too fixated on the training data, memorizing even irrelevant details and noise. This leads to impressive performance on the training data but poor performance on unseen data, hindering the model's ability to generalize. Regularization techniques introduce constraints or penalties that discourage the model from becoming overly complex, thereby reducing overfitting.\n",

    "Reduces Model Complexity: By penalizing complex models, regularization pushes them towards being simpler. This forces the model to focus on capturing the underlying trends in the data, rather than memorizing the specifics of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smoother Decision Boundaries: In classification tasks, regularization can help create smoother decision boundaries. These boundaries separate the different classes, and by making them smoother, the model becomes less sensitive to minor variations within the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Regularization Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression):\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique introduces a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of all the model's coefficients.\n",
    "In simpler terms, L1 regularization adds a cost for having large coefficient values. This pushes some coefficients towards zero, and in some cases, it can even drive them to become exactly zero. This effectively removes features with minimal impact on the model's performance, leading to a simpler model.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression):\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to L1, L2 regularization also adds a penalty term to the cost function. However, instead of using the absolute values, it uses the sum of the squares of the coefficients.\n",
    "L2 regularization penalizes large coefficient values, but it doesn't drive them to zero. This discourages the model from relying heavily on specific features and encourages smoother decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net:\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique combines the strengths of both L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "It incorporates a penalty term that includes both the sum of absolute values and the sum of squares of the coefficients. This allows for feature selection (like L1) while also promoting smoother decision boundaries (like L2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique doesn't directly modify the model itself. Instead, it focuses on the training process.\n",
    "During training, the model's performance is monitored on a separate validation set. Early stopping halts the training process when the performance on the validation set starts to decline. This prevents the model from continuing to memorize the training data and helps to avoid overfitting."
