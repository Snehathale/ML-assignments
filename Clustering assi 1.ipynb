The goal is to group similar data points together, minimizing the within-cluster variance.   \n\nHow K-means Works:\n\nInitialization:\n\nChoose K centroids: Randomly select K data points as initial cluster centroids. These centroids represent the initial \"centers\" of the clusters.   \nAssignment:\n\nAssign data points: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance. This creates K clusters, each associated with one of the K centroids.   \nUpdate Centroids:\n\nCalculate new centroids: For each cluster, calculate the mean of all the data points assigned to it. This mean becomes the new centroid for that cluster.   \nIteration:\n\nRepeat steps 2 and 3: Repeat the assignment and update steps until convergence, which means that the assignment of data points to clusters no longer changes significantly.   \nVisual Representation:\nOpens in a new window\nwww.researchgate.net\nKmeans clustering process\n\nKey Points:\n\nK: The number of clusters must be specified in advance.   \nCentroids: The centroids are the representative points of each cluster.   \nEuclidean Distance: This is commonly used to measure the distance between data points and centroids.   \nConvergence: The algorithm stops when the centroids no longer move significantly.   \nAdvantages:\n\nSimple and efficient: Relatively easy to understand and implement.   \nScalable: Can handle large datasets.   \nDisadvantages:\n\nSensitive to initial centroids: Different initializations can lead to different clustering results.   \nAssumes spherical clusters: May not work well with complex, non-spherical clusters.   \nRequires the number of clusters (K) in advance: This can be challenging to determine.   \nApplications:\n\nCustomer segmentation: Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior.   \nImage compression: Reducing the color palette of an image.   \nDocument clustering: Grouping similar documents together.   \nAnomaly detection: Identifying outliers in data.   \nBy understanding the K-means algorithm and its limitations, you can effectively apply it to various data mining and machine learning tasks.",
